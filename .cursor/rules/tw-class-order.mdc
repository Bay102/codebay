When creating Tailwind styles with responsive breakpoints, always use mobile-first order. Apply variants in this sequence: base (no prefix) → sm → md → lg → xl → 2xl.

Example (correct):
<div className="p-4 sm:p-6 md:p-8 lg:p-10" />

Example (incorrect - breakpoints out of order):
<div className="p-4 lg:p-10 sm:p-6 md:p-8" />

This keeps cascading predictable and makes responsive changes easier to reason about.
