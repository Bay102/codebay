# Component & Page Organization

- **Prefer small, focused files**: When creating new pages or large UI features, break the UI down into multiple focused components instead of a single very large file.

- **Extract reusable pieces**: If part of a page is conceptually distinct (e.g. hero section, sidebar, CTA block, table, form), extract it into its own component file.

- **Follow existing folder structure**: When extracting components, place them alongside similar files, following the current project structure and naming conventions (e.g. keep page-specific components under the same `pages`/`sections`/feature folder, and shared components under `components`).

- **Co-locate by feature**: Prefer organizing components by feature or page (e.g. `components/pages/blog/`) rather than only by technical type whenever it matches the existing structure.

- **Avoid “god components”**: If a single file grows beyond ~200–250 lines or requires you to constantly scroll to understand it, consider extracting logical sections into separate component files.

- **Keep file names descriptive**: Name extracted components after their domain role (e.g. `BlogHero.tsx`, `PricingTable.tsx`, `OnboardingSidebar.tsx`) instead of generic names like `Section.tsx` or `Block.tsx`.
